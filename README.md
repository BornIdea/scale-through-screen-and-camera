# scale-through-screen-and-camera

hello i am Yurda i love easy and quick solutions, i respect people's work, i love practical life, i want to make it more fulfilling using the available means, the idea is the following. 

How about measuring the weight of an object up to 50-150 grams ( Examples of objects on which we will look for weight, precious stones, gold, silver, food, property and much more ) -  with data from the screen, camera and available means of your phone,smartphone,tablet.


The data from the camera, the touch screen and the available sensors should be used and converted into geometric data in order to have an idea of ​​the volume, radius, length, height, width of a given object on which we will look for the weight.After converting the units of measure such as, length, mass, volume, digital storage and compare with the data on the touch screen to calculate the weight of an object on which you have previously taken pictures from different sides ( geometric data ) and the second step is placing the object on the touch screen which should also have the option to calculate volume, length and width.

We have the formulas through which all this data can be stored and calculated in order to use them and create a test field with which we will work and to build a new such formula from transformed data for the perfection of our product.
